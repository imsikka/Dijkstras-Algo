# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer(Ongoing)
This is a web-based visualizer for Dijkstra's algorithm. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize the algorithm in action. The application allows users to specify a start node and end node, and then visualizes the shortest path between the two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Installation
You can download the code directly from the GitHub repository, or you can clone it using the following command:


git clone https://github.com/imsikka/Dijkstras-Algo 

## Usage
Once you have downloaded or cloned the repository, simply open the index.html file in your web browser to launch the application. From there, you can select the start node and end node, and then click the "Visualize" button to see Dijkstra's algorithm in action.

## Features
Simple user interface
Visualizes Dijkstra's algorithm in real time
Allows users to specify start and end nodes
##Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
